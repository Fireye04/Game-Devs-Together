# Game Devs Together

Game Devs Together, or GDT, is an open source webring to serve as a community for game developers of all kinds.

Check out our website at [gdt.fireye.coffee](https://gdt.fireye.coffee) to see if you can join (hint: if you make games, have a website with the GDT widget (`<script src='https://gdt.fireye.coffee/scripts/widget.js'></script>`) somewhere on it, and aren't a bad actor, you should be good to go!). 

You don't need to be a member of the webring to join [discussions](https://github.com/Fireye04/Game-Devs-Together/discussions) though!

If you want to join but don't know how to operate a pull request, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Fireye04/Game-Devs-Together/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to hit up the forum!

## Dicussions

Our main discussion hub at the moment is via github discussions accessible from the tab above, or [here](https://github.com/Fireye04/Game-Devs-Together/discussions). Both members and non-members alike are more than welcome to join a conversation or open a thread.
