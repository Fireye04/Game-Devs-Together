# Game Devs Together

Game Devs Together, or GDT, is an open source webring to serve as a community for game developers of all kinds. 

## What's a webring?

At a base level, a webring is a community of personal website owners who link to each other's websites, commonly via a central site.

GDT will begin its life as one such site, with plans to gradually expand to something closer to a social hub. 
A few features that I hope to add down the line include:
- A Forum
- RSS Feed agreggator
- Improved site discovery

Of course, contributions and further suggestions are more than welcome.

## Cool, can I join?

Yes, with three caveats.
1. You make games. This includes but is not limited to: Video games, Board games, Tabletop RPGs, Branching narratives, or any other subdivision therein.
2. You own and operate a personal website. Custom domains are not required; Neocities and github pages-hosted sites are more than welcome.
3. You are a respectful individual. GDT is a place for those of all identies and backgrounds to share their love of game design; If your website features hateful speech, racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, or any other assorted nasties, you are not welcome here.

If you fit the criteria, you can join by opening up a PR adding your site's URL to the `sites.json` file.

## Contributing

GDT is an open source site by design, created both for the community and by the community. If you want to contribute, please don't hesitate to open an issue, or grab an existing one.
